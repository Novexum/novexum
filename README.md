# Novexum

**Novexum™** is an open hardware R&D brand focused on developing advanced FPGA platforms, high-speed communication systems, and engineering tools for embedded design and signal integrity analysis.

This repository represents the official identity of the Novexum organization, founded by **Konstantin Tiutin**.  
Key open-source projects include:

- `nvx.orc-a6x` — modular FPGA compute board  
- `nvx.orc-a7x` — modular FPGA compute board  
- `nvx.facc-k7` — FPGA acceleration core  
- `nvx.facc-au` — FPGA acceleration core  
- `nvx.facc-ku` — FPGA acceleration core  
- `OpenHLynx` — Gerber/S-parameter analysis and signal integrity toolkit

These platforms are fully open hardware. Schematics, layout files, BOMs, firmware, and example projects are publicly available to reproduce, adapt, and extend — whether for personal experimentation, academic research, or small-scale manufacturing.

## 🌐 Open Hardware Philosophy

I believe in accessible engineering. All schematics, layouts, firmware, and design files are open and permissively licensed — so that anyone can learn, build, and innovate.

Our trademarks (e.g. "Novexum", "nvx.orc") exist solely to preserve the clarity and trust associated with these open platforms. You’re free to reproduce and remix the hardware — just please don’t use the Novexum name or logo to market your own versions without permission.
